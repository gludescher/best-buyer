# best-buyer
Simple python crawler that fetches product data from pre-selected supermarket websites to list the best options for a purchase.

### Usage
For now, this application is only usable through Jupyter notebooks. Its usage, however, is quite straight-forward.
- Open notebook "interface.ipynb", it is the only notebook you'll need to run any cells manually;
- Run the import cells, so we can get all the dependencies we need;
- List the products you need as a Python list as you would search them in a supermarket website;
- Run the last cell and follow the instructions.
